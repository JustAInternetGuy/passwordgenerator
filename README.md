# passwordgenerator (py-raw)

This is the raw-python version of the code. Only use this if you are an advanced user, want to look into the code, modify the code and/or on an operating system that is not Windows or Windows-based. You will need an: IDE (integrated-development-enviorment), a python interpeter, the modules inside the python script and the files that came with downloading this raw code. You may also need other stuff, but you're probably an advanced user so I'll let you figure that out.
