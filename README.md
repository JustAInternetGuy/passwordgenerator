This is the Microsoft Installer Package version, (.msi) which means it can only be installed on Windows or Windows-based operating systems. To use, simply download the msi file on the ms-installer branch, and double click the file when installed. Afterwards, all you have to do is run the file and follow the installation guide. If you would like to use the raw-python release, at the right side of the github repository, click the password-generator-python release, release and follow the steps on that release.
